# House Price Prediction

This project implements a house price prediction system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and other relevant attributes.

## Project Description

House price prediction is a crucial task in the real estate industry. This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to estimate the price of houses based on historical data. The main steps in this project include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/bbiaggi88/house_price_prediction.git
cd house_price_prediction
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install the required packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the house price prediction analysis, launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `house_price_prediction.ipynb` file.

```
jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
```

In the notebook, you will find the complete workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
